The minimum shift length is 2 hours. Weekends begin at 7pm on Friday and end at 7am Monday morning. Holidays are billed at 50% greater than the above or “time-and-a-half”. Designated holidays are New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, July Fourth, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. Live-in rates noted above assume that the caregiver’s food comes from the family pantry. If for any reason this is not practical, then there will be an additional charge of $10 per day for the caregiver to supply his/her own food. If multiple service types or hours are requested, or if the service request changes, the rates may change accordingly. Rates for services are subject to review from time to time, but increases will be

subject to at least a four-week advance notice. We are required by law to pay our employees time-and-a-half if they work more than 40 hours per week. To accommodate the rates you have been quoted, we will manage your care in such a way that the employee does not work more than 40 hours in any Monday through Sunday timesheet period. If you would like a given caregiver to be assigned to work when it means they will be accruing overtime pay (and they are willing to work the overtime), you will be charged time-and-a-half. Flat rate shifts (e.g. ***Live-In*** ) assume the caregiver gets 8 hours sleep per night and do not attract overtime. Two or three disturbances are acceptable. If the caregiver is required to be awake all night then both the hourly rate (24 hr care) and overtime rule will apply. - **Deposits. **     - A deposit equivalent to two week’s service charge will be expected upon execution

of this contract before the start of services. The agreed total deposit is **$** . The deposit will be held by the agency without interest for the duration of services. Any unused portion of that amount will be promptly refunded to the patient upon termination of services. If you request an increase in services, the deposit will be increased proportionately. - **Billing**     - . The caregiver will fill out a timesheet daily. At the end of the caregiver’s work week

(Monday to Sunday), you will be expected to sign the timesheet as acceptance of the hours service delivered. Please sign it promptly so the caregiver can be paid promptly. After the start of services, invoices will be sent bi-weekly after completion of each service period.

Any questions regarding timesheets or your invoice should be directed to our office. - **Payment and Overdue Accounts. **     - Fees for services rendered are payable upon receipt of invoice. Payment may be made by check, money order or credit card. It is Four Seasons

Healthcare’s policy not to accept checks endorsed over to the agency. All payments must be remitted to the address noted above; direct care workers are not permitted to accept payment. An account is considered overdue if not paid within 10 days of the billing date. Interest will be charged on account balances which remain unpaid for 5 days or more after the same becomes due at the rate of 1.5 % per month (18 % per annum), until paid. We reserve the right to discontinue providing services until the account is paid in full, including any additional charges and accrued interest. A $25.00 returned check fee will be charged. Checks are to be made payable to Four Season Healthcare. - **Cancellations. **     - Cancellations may be made up to 24 hours in advance of a scheduled visit without charge. We reserve the right to charge for a scheduled visit if insufficient notice is not given. In the event that a referred caregiver fails to arrive at the care recipient’s home, we will make every effort to find a replacement as quickly as possible. If a replacement is not found or if the caregiver alters the predetermined weekly schedule in some way, we will adjust the amount that you are billed accordingly.
